# Project Name: Simple ATM Application
## Overview:
The "Simple ATM Application" is a comprehensive Java-based simulation that emulates the core functionalities of a typical Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is not just a demonstration of my ability to replicate an ATM's functionality, but it also showcases my skills in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented programming and creating graphical user interfaces.

## Functionality:
The application allows users to interact with virtual bank accounts in various ways. It supports basic banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing funds, alongside displaying detailed account information. The system incorporates several classes representing different aspects of banking, like individual bank accounts, savings and cheque accounts with their unique features, and a central bank class managing these accounts.

## User Interface:
What sets this application apart is its user-friendly graphical interface, designed for ease of use. It closely mimics the real-world ATM experience, ensuring that users can intuitively navigate through different banking options. This aspect of the project highlights my proficiency in developing accessible and functional user interfaces.

## Technical Highlights:

- Object-Oriented Design: The application is structured around key OOP principles, utilizing inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. This design approach allows for efficient code management and scalability.
- Error Handling and Validation: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth operation and user feedback during invalid transactions or inputs.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developed using Java's Swing framework, the GUI is both responsive and intuitive, making the application accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
## Conclusion:
The Simple ATM Application is a testament to my capabilities in Java programming and GUI development. It serves as a practical example of how software can be designed to simplify and emulate real-world financial transactions, making it a significant and relevant addition to my portfolio.
